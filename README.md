# NYT_Popular_Keywords

This is a project that looks at the most used keywords in a specified number of top NYT articles from the current day. The project then ranks them and creates a barchart to display them visually. The data for this is retrived from the New York Times API which is free to sign up for and use, this means if you want to run this project simply change out the API KEY variable used here for your personal one. The code for the project is available in a regular Python file, or as a Jupyter notebook.
